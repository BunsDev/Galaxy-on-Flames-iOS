# Galaxy_on_Flames
A JavaScript RPG adventure, totally not based on the IOS game Galaxy on Fire!

Spent a sleepless week creating this masterpiece. It's still one of my best memories of programming, just night after night of trying to finish this and trying to fix all the bugs and get everything to work before a deadline. I had to use so much brainpower to code all those functions that reference each other, my brain hurts just thinking about it. The funny thing is, the majority of the game is hard-coded. That's why everything's such a mess and took so long to do. There's still a few bugs, mainly that the charge system during battle doesn't really work. But I'm still proud of this game. It's basically my most advanced game, and it's a turn-based RPG, my favourite genre of games. Perhaps I should become a game developer?

If you want to play it, you have to download the entire repository, all into one folder on your local computer, then open the index.html file on your browser. You can use the "download zip" option from the green button that says code. Have fun!
