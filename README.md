# Galaxy_on_Flames
A JavaScript RPG adventure, totally not based on the IOS game Galaxy on Fire!

Spent a sleepless week creating this masterpiece. It's still one of my best memories of programming, just night after night of trying to finish this and trying to fix all the bugs and get everything to work before a deadline. I had to use so much brainpower to code all those functions that reference each other, my brain hurts just thinking about it. There's still a few bugs, mainly that the charge system during battle doesn't really work. But I'm still proud of this game. It's basically my most advanced game, and it's a turn-based RPG, my favourite genre of games. Perhaps I should become a game developer?
